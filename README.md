# steam_analysis

The project presented here is part of the Data Science Course at Allwomen, 
in which by the end of the course all students should challenge themselves by working on their project. 
In which, during three weeks, we had to scrap the data, clean it, ask questions, and present it with plots, and maybe 
create a machine learning model.

I love games, so I choose to work with a Steam dataset, which I've scrapped using an API. For that, I follow the steps available
on this blog: https://nik-davis.github.io/posts/2019/steam-data-collection/.

All the steps were made in python. I've started to clean the data and to do all the next steps.
I split the project into two parts the first part is exploratory data analysis and the second part 
I build a machine learning model to recommend games based on similarity in terms of user rating and game genre.

To present the result I create an APP on Streamlit, where I interactively displayed all the information,
then you can play with all the results, and extract some information. 

On the link (https://readymag.com/u4218013253/3273935/) you can find my web page with my presentation, created on Readymag! On that, you have a link for the 
Streamlit app.

Have fun!!
